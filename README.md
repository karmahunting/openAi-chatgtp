A simple and mid way of using openai without the web interface, Dm me for a api key


IF you can get your own api key go to: https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys Create a new secret key, and copy it in the code at line 4 like this:
openai.api_key = "<your-api-key>"
  
  You could also dm me on discord to ask for a api key, all tho I am will not be responseble for stupid stuff you do
