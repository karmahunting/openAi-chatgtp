# openAi-chatgtp
A simple and mid way of using openai without the web interface, Dm me for a api key


IF you can get your own api key go to: https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys Create a new secret key, and copy it in the code at line 4 like this:
openai.api_key = "<your-api-key>"
  
  You could also dm me on discord to ask for a api key, all tho I am will not be responseble for stupid stuff you do.

  
  To use this you have to first download the latest version of python here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
  after installing python you have to execute it via the command line. On windows you can press win + r and typ: cmd
  A window will pop up, Now Simpely go to the location of the file with "cd C:\YourPathHere" Now typ: python3 openai_chatgtp.py
